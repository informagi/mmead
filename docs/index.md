# MMEAD: MS MARCO Entity Annotations and Disambiguations

## What is MMEAD?
MMEAD, or MS MARCO Entity Annotations and Disambiguations, is a specification for entity links
for the [MSMARCO](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) dataset. MMEAD proposes a JSON specification on how
entity links can be shared for easier usage of entity links. Entity links produced by the
[Radboud Entity Linker (REL)](https://github.com/informargi/rel) are provided. Code to easily work with this data is available.
